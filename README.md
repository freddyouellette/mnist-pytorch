An introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks in Python, training and improving a model to recognize handwritten numbers.

## Step 1: Na√Øve Training
Read or run the [Jupyter Notebook](./train.ipynb) that trains a simple Convolutional Neural Network by manually selecting hyperparameters.

## Step 2: Random Search
Can we get a better-scoring model? How? Read or run the [Jupyter Notebook](./search.ipynb) to learn about how to perform a basic [Random Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_search).

## Step 3: Manual Testing
If you've run the [Training Jupyter Notebook](./train.ipynb) yourself, you will have a model saved. You can test it with handwritten numbers you draw yourself. Run this command in the terminal to start a Streamlit demo, and click on the link that appears.
```
make demo
